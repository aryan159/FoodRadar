### App Idea

My team came up with the idea for the app during a Sustainability Hackathon. Our idea was simple, to build a platform that connects those with excess food to those who need or are willing to take that food. Through market research and business planning, we decided that building an app centered around letting businesses offload excess food at the end of the day would gain traction the fastest and had the highest chance of success

### The App

The app is map based and shows the position and details of all nearby food establishments in relation to the user's position. It also allows business owners to sign in with their google account to register their business and manage alerts.
